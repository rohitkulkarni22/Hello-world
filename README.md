# Hello-world
Just a repo
Starman here, I'm from the red planet which humans call Mars. Mars is a very small planet compared to your planet Earth, I would love to stay on Earth for my summer vacation.
You guys have a ton of water here, we don't have these beautiful beaches at Mars. You guys are damn lucky.
Do you know bro, we have a the tallest mountain in the entire solar system i.e Mt. Olympus, named after the mount olympus in Greek mythology.
One thing I find very strange about humans is that you guys call your history as mythology. I mean we don't do that on Mars.
