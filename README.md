# Hello-world
Just a repo
Starman here, I'm from the red planet which humans call Mars. Mars is a very small planet compared to your planet Earth, I would love to stay on Earth for my summer vacation.
You guys have a ton of water here, we don't have these beautiful beaches at Mars. You guys are damn lucky.
Do you know bro, we have a the tallest mountain in the entire solar system.
